# Agent-Based Tournament Coding Challenge (TU Delft - EPA1315 Data Analysis and Visualization)

## Introduction

In the agent-based tournament coding challenged each agent has to face an interated prisoner's dilemma. The prisoners dilemma is extensively studied in multiple scientific areas, such as economics, machine learning and evolutionary biology [1]. The core concept of the game is that each of the two competitors can choose 1 of 2 option for each round. These options are to either defect or cooperate. Both player simultaneously and independently select an option and depending on both options a payoff for each player is determined.



Payoff | Cooperate | Defect
--- | --- | ---
Cooperate| 4/4 | 0/5
Defect | 5/0 | 2/2








## Common Strategies 

#### 1. Always Cooperate
Cooperates on every move, as a strategie this can be considered very social but not most benefial for own interest

#### 2. Always Defect
Defects on every move, this is considered a 'hard' strategy'.

#### 3. Tit for Tat
Cooperates on the first move, then simply copies the opponent’s last move. In experimental tournaments this strategy turned out surprisingly successful.

#### 4. Suspicious Tit for Tat
Same as Tit for Tat, except that it defects on the first move.

#### 5. Pavlov
Cooperates on the first move, and defects only if both the players did not agree on the previous move. 

#### 6. Spiteful
Cooperates, until the opponent defects, and thereafter always defects. Can work out positively in terms of own interest, but may also be risky if first opponent defect occurs early.

#### 7. Random Player
Makes a random move each turn again.

#### 8. Periodic player CD:
Plays C, D periodically.

#### 9. Periodic player DDC
Plays D, D, C periodically.

#### 10. Periodic player CCD
Plays C, C, D periodically.

#### 11. Tit for Two Tats
Cooperates on the first move, and defects only when the opponent defects two times. Compared to the regular tit for tat, this strategy is more socially oriented.

#### 12. Soft Majority
Begins by cooperating, and cooperates as long as the number of times the opponent has cooperated is greater than or equal to the number of times it has defected, else it defects.

#### 13, Hard Majority
Defects on the first move, and defects if the number of defections of the opponent is greater than or equal to the number of times it has cooperated, else cooperates.

#### 14. Hard Tit for Tat
Cooperates on the first move, and defects if the opponent has defects on any of the previous three moves, else cooperates.

#### 15. NaiveProber
Like TitforTat,but occasionally, randomly defects.

#### 16. Remorseful Prober :
Like Naive Prober, but it tries to break the series of mutual defections after defecting.

## Selected Strategie

### Axelrod single- objective evolutionary algorithm

The concept of our agent is based on the fact that for each move in the game there are four possibilities. Both players can cooperate (CC or R for reward), the first player cooperats and the other player defects (CD or S for sucker), the first player can defect and the second cooperates (DC or T for temptation), or both players defect (DD or P for penalty). For our strategie we consider the last three moves as a three letter code. For instance, the situation is which the last three rounds both agents cooperated, has a three letter sequence RRR.

This combination of letters is used to generate a number 0:63. This is done by setting R=0, T=1, S=2 and P=3 and interpret it as a number on base 4. SSP for instance is 43 is this way. Each of the numbers 0:63 either stands for defect or cooperate, therefore based on the last 3 moves a option is selected. Since this decision is based upon the last the 3 moves, the first three moves cannot be defined by this strategy. For this reason these are defected.

An Exception is made for the so called "lemon agents", these agents are introducing themselves by saying "lemon" and will always cheat. For this reason, in a situation of an opponent that introduces itself by "lemon" the defect option is always selected.

## Creating the 64 bit string


This is our code.

Our code runs from `main.R` and calls modularized functions in the `/scripts/` folder.

We used the following function:
```{R}
### Main File to run things in!
#source('scripts/raw_parser.R', chdir = TRUE)
#source('scripts/extract_statistics.R', chdir = TRUE)
a = 123
## Run parser to create string
#data_frame = axelrod_encode(raw_parser('data/tournament.csv'))

## Run parsed array through statistics
#axelrod_string = extract_statistics(data_frame)
#View(axelrod_string)

## Modify main string with statistical results
# Did Siemon complete this step already? Or is this still to be done?

## Run agent
